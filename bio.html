    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>
    Working as render programmer @ Ubisoft Belgrade
    During the day I work on programming 3D computer graphics for 
    AAA games, while at night I work as digital artist in domain
    of new media and computer art. Mostly I've been inspired by 90s 
    demo scene and new media movements.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am using computers to create interactive computing and visual
    interfaces which try to convey certain message while being
    aesthetically pleasing.

<h3>- DESCRIPTION</h3>
    My biggest struggle is trying to put skills of making pixels on screens
    flash, dance, move and react to something that is beyond digital.
    At least that's how I wish to percieve it. That moment of interaction
    between worlds we don't see [air (full of magnetic signals and networks), 
    internet (immensly high bandwith information highway)] and something
    in front of our face (screen).
    </p>
    <p>
    I've worked with artists, held presentations in domain of digital
    computer art, did live visual sets and provided wide variety of visual solutions.
