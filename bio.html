    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>
    During the day I work on programming 3D computer graphics, while at night I work in domain of digital and computer art. Mostly I've been inspired by 90s demo scene and new media movements. As a kid I've spent too much time on Newgrounds.

    I am using computers to create interactive computing and visual interfaces which try to convey certain message while being aesthetically pleasing. Specializing in Vulkan/DX12, graphics pipeline optimizations on game renderers, creating interactive interfaces both hardware and software. Mostly interested in low level, high performance graphics programming and creative work in domain of visual and new media arts. Have experience on working with AAA game engine's renderers. Proficient in C++ and C, whith occasional experiments in Rust and Clojure. Also I've spent solid amount of time reading GPU bytecode in RenderDoc.

    Looking for work in gamdev or creative domains, where I could apply low level graphics programming skills in making tools and solutions for creating real time visuals and computer graphics. For creative and artistic endeavors I've worked in openFrameworks and TouchDesigner. Besides that had experience with Notch, Max/MSP, VVVV, Kinect and LeapMotion. Currently learning and experimenting with Unreal Engine.

    Dropped out of two colleges, where I gained wide sets of skills; I've found what I wanted to do whereas formal education didn't provide anything mildly interesting or related to that. That's the reason why I saw it as a chore and huge time sink. During that time I worked mostly on some freelance projects and many personal ones until I got to position of render programmer at Ubisoft.

    - tools [ openFrameworks | Notch | TouchDesigner | Max/MSP | Unreal Engine ]</br>
    - medium [ computer graphics | digital signals | audio input | depth cameras ]</br>
    - motives [ accelerationism | aesthetics | hacking culture ]</br>

    What I like to do the most is trying to put skills of making pixels on screens flash, dance, move and react to something that is beyond digital. At least that's how I wish to percieve it. That moment of interaction between worlds we don't see [air (full of magnetic fields, signals and networks), internet (immensly high bandwith information highway)] and something in front of our face (screen). Love doing unorthodox work, experimenting with technology and gaining various skills.

    I've worked with artists, held presentations in domain of digital computer art, did live visual sets and provided wide variety of visual solutions.

    Besides programming I love reading and drawing. During the weekends I DJ pretty often in local Belgrade underground clubs.
